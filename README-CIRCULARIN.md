# CircularIN Platform Implementation

This document provides information about the CircularIN platform implementation in the Wete Municipal Waste Management Portal.

## Overview

CircularIN is a comprehensive platform designed to empower individuals and businesses to participate in the circular economy and enhance waste management practices. The platform includes:

1. **Networking** - Connect with other waste management professionals
2. **Marketplace** - Buy and sell waste materials and recycled products
3. **Job Board** - Find career opportunities in the circular economy sector
4. **Events Calendar** - Discover industry events and workshops

## Setup Instructions

### Required Directories

The following directory structure needs to be set up:

```
public/assets/images/
├── avatars/           # User and company avatars
├── company-logos/     # Logos for companies
├── events/            # Event images
├── logos/             # Platform and government logos
└── marketplace/       # Product images for marketplace
```

### JavaScript

The platform functionality is handled by `public/js/circular-in.js`. This file should be included in the layout to enable interactive features.

### Image Placeholders

You should add placeholder images to the directories created above. The CircularIN page references images with the following patterns:

- `assets/images/logos/circular-in-logo.png` - The CircularIN platform logo
- `assets/images/circular-in-platform.png` - Platform illustration image
- `assets/images/avatars/*.jpg` - User avatars
- `assets/images/company-logos/*.png` - Company logos
- `assets/images/marketplace/*.jpg` - Product images
- `assets/images/events/*.jpg` - Event images
