 # WCAG 2.1 Compliance Implementation Guide

This document outlines the accessibility updates made to the Wete Portal system to ensure compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. These updates enhance the system's accessibility for users with various disabilities.

## Updates Implemented

### 1. Layout and Structure Improvements

- Added skip links to allow keyboard users to bypass navigation and go directly to main content
- Implemented proper heading hierarchy throughout templates (`h1` through `h6`)
- Added ARIA landmarks to identify main regions of the page (`role="banner"`, `role="main"`, `role="navigation"`, `role="contentinfo"`)
- Identified main content with ID for skip links to target (`id="main-content"`)

### 2. Navigation Enhancements

- Added `aria-current="page"` attributes to indicate current page in navigation
- Added `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`, and `aria-label` attributes to dropdown menus
- Ensured all submenu elements have proper ARIA labels

### 3. Form Accessibility

- Added missing form labels (e.g., newsletter email input field)
- Added `aria-label` attributes to form elements that didn't have visible labels
- Ensured validation errors are properly associated with form fields

### 4. Image Accessibility

- Added descriptive alt text to images
- Marked decorative icons as `aria-hidden="true"`

### 5. Color Contrast and Visual Presentation

- Updated color scheme variables to ensure sufficient contrast ratios
- Added `:focus` styles to make keyboard navigation visible
- Provided visual indication for interactive elements

### 6. Meta Information

- Added proper page descriptions with meta description tags
- Added language attributes to HTML elements

## Further Recommendations

### Additional Updates Needed

1. **Forms Accessibility**:
   - Review all form elements to ensure they have proper labels
   - Add error handling that is perceivable by screen readers
   - Ensure form validation messages are clear and accessible

2. **Dynamic Content**:
   - Add ARIA live regions for dynamically updated content
   - Ensure modal dialogs are properly implemented with `role="dialog"` and focus management

3. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Test and ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Implement proper focus management for modals and dropdowns
   - Add keyboard shortcuts where appropriate with proper documentation

4. **Screen Reader Compatibility**:
   - Test with popular screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Add hidden text descriptions for complex visualizations

5. **Additional Content Pages**:
   - Continue updating all remaining view files following the same principles
   - Pay special attention to content-heavy pages and forms

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Automated Testing**:
   - Use tools like Axe, WAVE, or Lighthouse to identify accessibility issues
   - Integrate accessibility testing into CI/CD pipeline

2. **Manual Testing**:
   - Test with keyboard-only navigation
   - Test with screen readers
   - Test with high contrast mode
   - Test with text zoom (up to 200%)

3. **User Testing**:
   - Conduct testing with users who have disabilities
   - Collect feedback on accessibility improvements
